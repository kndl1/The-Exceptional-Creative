			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know how they pull it off, but every year for the past three years, the <a href="http://www.otasessions.com/" target="_blank">OTA Sessions</a> team has brought a rock star line-up into Sioux Falls, SD for a stellar one-day event. This year was the first I could attend; I was definitely not disappointed. There&#8217;s variety, energy, creativity, humor, sincerity and some serious work ethic put into every moment of the conference. I&#8217;ll be back again and again.</p>
<p>Since I know many of you didn&#8217;t don your snowsuits and snow boots to make the trek up to South Dakota, here are a few choice quotes from the day from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Leipzig" target="_blank">Adam Leipzig</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buchanan-Smith" target="_blank">Peter Buchanan-Smith</a>, <a href="http://thefrontieragency.com/" target="_blank">Ron Arnold</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Braun" target="_blank">Adam Braun</a>, <a href="http://www.micro-documentaries.com/index.html" target="_blank">Ben Henretig</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ricardocrespo/15/298/196" target="_blank">riCardo crespo</a> and our beloved <a href="http://draplin.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Draplin</a>. (By the way, did you catch <a href="/2012/10/designer-to-designer-money-matters-with-aaron-james-draplin/" target="_blank">my interview with Aaron about money</a>?)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Draplin is a force to be reckoned with in the design world. If you&#8217;re not yet acquainted with Aaron and the <a title="DDC" href="http://www.draplin.com/" target="_blank">DDC</a> (Draplin Design Co.), it&#8217;s about time you&#8217;re introduced. There are many reasons to admire Aaron; not only does he run his own <a href="http://www.draplin.com/" target="_blank">design studio</a>, sell <a href="http://www.draplin.com/merch/" target="_blank">studio merchandise</a>, shamelessly hawk <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank">Field Notes</a> left to right and <a href="http://www.draplin.com/gigs/" target="_blank">scamper around the country speaking</a>, but he knows how to manage all the &#8216;loot&#8217; that comes of it, as he would say. Let&#8217;s face it: money matters. Just because you&#8217;re creative doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t crunch numbers and keep your books straight. Aaron is a down-to-earth example of just such principle. Aaron, thank you so much for sharing your frank thoughts on what can be a delicate topic &#8211; cursing and all.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/designertodesigner-DRAPLIN.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453" title="designertodesigner-DRAPLIN" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/designertodesigner-DRAPLIN.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="153" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>How do you feel about money in general?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>It’s something that I fear, of course. I grew up in a family that seemingly had everything, yet at an older age, mom and dad told me of some pretty lean times. I never knew any of that. And for that perception, I thank them. I mean, I knew we didn’t have what some of the families up the food chain had, but it didn’t matter. I was kept busy with a million activities, Legos, drawing, baseball, swimming and general trouble making.</p>
<p>And still, money is something I fear. Or, the idea of not having enough is a thumping gorilla that drives me to work as hard as I do. I don’t want to be compromised, ever. I lived a couple of those years, and know what it was like to have to go without. It stung. It made me bitter and small and unnecessarily guarded. All bad stuff. I knew I had it in me, but didn’t know I’d be able to pull it all off. I will never forget the fear I felt with each credit card statement showing up. Such a fuckin’ racket, and I fell into it face first.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>How much money did you have on hand when you decided to go out on your own? How did you determine if it was enough?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>I had enough to get into my house, and then shortly, afterwards, had saved enough to “pay rent for three years.” Like, say the work dried up? I had my ass covered for three years. That was first taste of security.  A state of mind I earned with my own two hands. And that’s where shit took off for me. Once I had the big shit locked down, it opened the world up. I wasn’t afraid anymore. I could risk loot on personal projects. I could invest in better equipment. And most importantly, I could take off for a couple months, cruise America and live on the cheap, all the while, working at night and keeping the clients happy.</p>
<p>But that number, when I head out on my own? It was about $20,000. I finally paid off my goddamn credit card in 2003, and it was amazing how the money started to actually add up. No one told me that. I was just used to feeling beat down. Once I got myself out of that hole, I haven’t looked back.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>Where does most of your work (ahem, money) come from at this point in your career?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>Client retainers make up the bulk of it. Then one on one gigs. Then <a href="http://www.draplin.com/merch/" target="_blank">DDC merch</a>. Then <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank">Field Notes</a>. And holy shit, writing those out, I get slapped in the face with: All shit that I love. So proud of that.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>What&#8217;s the most risky financial decision you&#8217;ve made in your business? In retrospect, was it a good or bad decision?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>It’s nothing too wild, really. I’ve made small steps since I got out of the hole. That’s something mom and dad taught me.</p>
<p>Buying a house was scary. Paying the fucker off was a triumph over the sharktoothed bankers that’ll gladly pillage you for years. I’m still high from that one. No more throwin’ money away at some bank, while they simply hold the note. No one told me I’d be able to do this. I had to ask the banker if it was okay? And she sorta laughed, and passed me up the food chain. And of course, some turd in blue shirt and tie tried to talk me into investing it. But man, I walk a little taller these days with that mess off my back. Plain and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>How do you handle the inconsistencies of being self-employed? How does your budget work?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>I don’t pay for things I can’t afford. Just as simple as that. And, I often pay the shit up front, just to get it out of the way. Bills are paid the moment I get them. Same goes for credit card statements. I don’t like that shit weighing on my so I nip it in the bud the moment they come on my radar.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>Have you gone into debt for your business?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>Not one goddamn bit!</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>If you had more money, what would you do (personally or professionally)?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>I’d pay off all the worries of those close to me. And in all frankness, have been doing it here and there. I just want everyone to be comfortable. It doesn’t take much. So I’m working my ass off now while the phone is ringing, and one by one, taking care of those I love. Very proud of this shit, and feel a little weird writing it out for all to read.</p>
<p><strong>Q / </strong>What would you tell yourself 10 years ago regarding finances?</p>
<p><strong>A / </strong>It’d be something like this: “Relax, you dick. The work is gonna come. And with that, loot. Believe in yerself, work hard and the rest’ll fall into place. Pay off those school loans as fast as possible. Then start chipping away at the house. Then the car.”</p>
<p>And the thing is, that’s exactly what I’ve done!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember <a title="Armin Vit Money Matters" href="/2012/05/designer-to-designer-money-matters-with-armin-vit/" target="_blank">Armin Vit</a>?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bnc_2012_logo-over.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1423" title="bnc_2012_logo-over" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bnc_2012_logo-over.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="99" /></a></p>
<p>Well, he puts on this killer conference each year called the <a title="Brand New Conference" href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/" target="_blank">Brand New Conference</a>. If you&#8217;re just learning about it for the first time, it&#8217;s likely a little too late to <a title="Brand New Conference Reservations" href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/registration.php" target="_blank">snag a reservation</a> and book a flight to New York since the event takes place next Friday, September 7. (Maybe not? If you live within driving distance, go!)</p>
<p>But! Guess what! <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/registration.php" target="_blank">You can attend remotely</a>. No joke. I&#8217;m definitely signing up and tuning into the webcast to hear <a title="Brand New Conference Speakers" href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/speakers.php" target="_blank">Howard Belk, Simon Manchipp, Miles Newlyn, Mike Rigby, Massimo Vignelli, Yolanda Santosa, Yah-Leng Yu</a> and our ever beloved <a title="Aaron James Draplin Blog Post" href="/2012/05/creative-mornings-with-aaron-james-draplin/" target="_blank">Aaron James Draplin</a> (Portland, represent!).</p>

<p>When you think of careers that are hard on one&#8217;s body, you might think &#8220;construction worker&#8221; &#8220;ballerina&#8221; or &#8220;sumo wrestler&#8221;. You certainly don&#8217;t think &#8220;designer&#8221;. All we do is sit and move our hands around. Day in. Day out. No big deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>Reality check: sitting is <em>really </em>bad for you.</strong></p>
<p><a title="Forbes" href=" http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglatter/2012/05/27/sitting-at-work-increases-your-chance-of-dying/" target="_blank">Forbes even says so.</a><br />
<a href=" http://www.npr.org/2011/04/25/135575490/sitting-all-day-worse-for-you-than-you-might-think" target="_blank">As does NPR.</a></p>

<p><em>Eek.</em></p>
<p>Do I also need to point out all the craning forward to stare into a screen all day, moving that darn mouse back and forth and generally ignoring your body&#8217;s needs while you whip up the world&#8217;s next greatest logo, brochure or band poster? Now, do I think that your designer tendencies are a death wish? No. But I do believe that our day-to-day habits shape our health, so&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&#8217;ve compiled some tips gleaned from my time in the field:</span></p>
<p><strong>Get cracking.</strong> I started getting regular chiropractic adjustments when my back was bothering me a year or so ago. It&#8217;s made a world of difference. Once I paired them with massage, the trouble spot under my shoulder blade was finally wrangled into submission. Whew. If you can&#8217;t afford massage, try a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3407871">foam roller</a> or a <a href="http://www.theracane.com/">Theracane</a> to address points of tension.</p>
<p>Speaking of trouble spots, at one point I started wearing a wrist brace because of the constant pain I was experiencing in my right wrist. Turns out all that detailed vector work with the pen tool had finally caught up with me. At the time, I was bewildered. What in the world was I supposed to do to make it through the next 30 years of my design career? Learn to work with my left hand? Simply direct the mouse with my eyes? I think not. Fortunately, a friend who worked for <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Intuos/Large.aspx">Wacom</a> recommended I try a tablet. I promptly bought the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Intuos/Large.aspx">Intuos</a> and within three days was designing brace-free. Miraculous, no? (I even pack that sucker along when I travel now because it makes that big of a difference.) <strong>Throw $400 at Wacom.</strong> You won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p><strong>Sit tall.</strong> Hello, expensive office chairs. I scored big time and got <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/work-chairs/mirra-chairs.html">my Herman Miller Mirra chair</a> from an agency I worked for when it went bankrupt. Before that I was on a vintage wooden chair my parents had salvaged from a trash pile years ago. Shabby chic, yes. Comfy, no. For some, a stability ball or standing desk might do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Eyeball it.</strong> Models call their faces their money-makers. For designers, it&#8217;s our eyes. Hit up the local optometrist, invest in a large monitor and don&#8217;t forget to give those money-making orbs a break. See next tip.</p>
<p><strong>Dig out the egg timer. </strong>Try the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>. Bundle tasks into 25 minute increments (sayonara multi-tasking!), each followed by a 5 minute break. Interestingly enough, this frequency is about the same as what my chiropractor recommends for standing up to stretch. Hm.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention exercise. Duh. <strong>Get out and move. </strong>(If you really want your butt kicked, try <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do">Insanity</a>. It&#8217;s the opposite of what us designers do all day.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and water. <strong>Chug it.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I have a proposition for you:</strong> Compete with me.</p>
<p>With is obviously the key word. If you compete <em>with</em> me rather than against me and I compete <em>with</em> you rather than against you, what we&#8217;re actually doing is <strong>collaborating</strong>.</p>
<p>Why should we collaborate? For work, of course. We need to collaborate to keep design work from non-designers, stock logo sites and over zealous marketing gurus. But how? What can we actually commit to do together that will assure the work comes and stays where it should.</p>
<p><strong>What about higher design standards? </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Don&#8217;t let anything out the door that isn&#8217;t as good as it could be.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>An exceptional level of professionalism? </strong></p>
<p>There are lots of tips here on the blog. Step it up.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fair pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know what that looks like? <a title="Graphic Artists Guild Handbook" href="https://www.graphicartistsguild.org/handbook/">Get this book.</a> Don&#8217;t forget to <a title="Hourly Rate Worksheet" href="/thetoolkit/shop">figure out your hourly rate</a>, too.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And a campaign against stealing intellectual property?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://drawsigner.com/2011/08/26/logogate-2011/">This guy</a> has dealt with his fair share. Make sure you&#8217;re doing your part and creating original artwork.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that&#8217;d be a good start.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/competenew.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1376" title="competenew" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/competenew.gif" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Collaboration is the new competition.&#8221;</strong> I don&#8217;t remember where I heard this, but I like it.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m actually a fan of competition, in that an economy requires it to function as it should. But, in the design world I think there&#8217;s a lot that can be done if we work together on the big picture items, as articulated above.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://courtenayhameister.wordpress.com/">Courtenay</a> since we worked together when I was still at an ad agency. We hired her as often as we could because she&#8217;s hysterical, humble and one-of-a-kind. These are all things you&#8217;ll see through <a href="http://courtenayhameister.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/things-one-might-say-to-a-class-of-graduating-seniors/">the commencement address</a> she composed and presented in Portland a couple of weeks ago. Courtenay is graciously allowing me to re-post her commentary (but you can also <a title="Courtenay Hameister Commencement Address" href="http://soundcloud.com/live-wire-radio/oes-graduation-speech-by">listen to it</a> or <a title="Courtenay Hameister Commencement Address" href="http://courtenayhameister.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/things-one-might-say-to-a-class-of-graduating-seniors/">read it on her blog</a>); I asked to do so because what she composed is relevant to all of us wanting to go out and so something with our lives. Whether you&#8217;re 18 or 81, read on and then thank Courtenay for her impactful insight.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/courtenay.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1369" title="Courtenay Hameister, Commencement Address" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/courtenay.gif" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Hey Overachievers! Try Failing!</strong></p>
<p>Graduating class, faculty, parents and friends. Thank you for inviting me to speak to you here today – I’m so honored at the opportunity, and also curious as to whether the internet was broken the day I was asked, because I have a lot of incriminating tweets out there. I also appreciate the cap and gown, and that you chose to give me one of the black ones. Black is super slimming. The giant tent shape, however, less so.</p>
<p>I’d like to start off with a huge congratulations to the <a href="http://www.oes.edu/">OES</a> graduating class of 2012. I’ve heard from your college counselors that your class has 100% college acceptance this year, which is a tremendous accomplishment, and one you should be very proud of. But it also brings me to my first advice for tonight, and that’s that no one likes a showoff. Think about maybe 99% next time around, just not to seem so flashy.</p>
<p>So now you’re off to college. 100% of you. What sort of knowledge can I impart that will help you survive?</p>
<p>First off, the Freshman 15 does exist. It was actually the Freshman 40 for me, but don’t be intimidated by that because I’ve always been an overachiever. Just don’t beat yourself up if you gain a little weight in college. Your weight doesn’t define you. And the world is a rough place, so just think of it as building up your protective shell, like a tortoise or IronMan.</p>
<p>Secondly, there has never been, in the history of mankind, a person who did a series of Jagerbombs, and thought the next morning, “I’m so proud of the choices I made last night. I really feel like I’m growing as a person.”</p>
<p>Third, college is possibly the only time in your life when it’s not only okay to be terrible at things, it’s advisable.</p>
<p>Let me clarify, before your parents rush the stage and tackle me.</p>
<p>Ira Glass, the host of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a> said a great thing about creative pursuits. He talked about this gap that happens when you start your first project. This gap between your taste, which is probably impeccable, and your talent, which is raw, and sometimes, in the beginning, nonexistent. It’s that period where you know good work when you see it, but you’re not making it yet.</p>
<p>It’s an uncomfortable gap, filled with self-doubt and frustration, but if you find something you love, you’ll endure it. For instance, maybe you’ve always thought structural engineering was your thing but in college, you discover a love for robotics. So you take a class, and you make a robot. And for no discernable reason you can point to, your robot starts spouting expletives at inopportune moments (I don’t know when an opportune moment to spout expletives is. A Wu Tang Clan concert?). First of all, that’s a pretty cool mistake, but second of all, GOOD. Wear that failure like a badge of honor. That failure says “I’ve been brave enough to be horrible at something, and to trust myself enough to know that won’t always be true. I’ve reached beyond my comfort zone, and look what I’ve found: a completely profane robot. I rule.”</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Do one thing a day that scares you.”</p>
<p>I say, “Shut up, Eleanor Roosevelt. Do you have any idea how many things scare me already?” Double dip recession, people eating other people’s faces off, the fact that leg warmers were fashionable not once, but twice in this country – I don’t know who’s in charge of this stuff, but it’s terrifying. So no, don’t do one thing a day that scares you. Do one thing, say, every two weeks that scares you.</p>
<p>That’s the schedule I’m on. I’ve been hosting <a href="http://www.livewireradio.org/">a radio variety show</a> in front of a live audience for eight years now, and every single show, every single time I stand beside that stage waiting to go on, I’m petrified. Of what? You name it. Will I ask a dumb question? Will my monologue bomb? Is my skirt tucked into my underwear? Will one of my castmates eat my face off?</p>
<p>Here’s something I didn’t know until just a few years ago that I wish I knew when I was your age.</p>
<p>Everyone is scared. No one has it figured out.</p>
<p>We all look at people at the top of their game, and we’re envious. We wonder what it would be like to be that successful, that self-assured, that certain of every choice that we make.</p>
<p>But let’s take one of those top-of-their-game people as an example – Judd Apatow. Judd is the director of The 40 Year-old Virgin and Knocked Up; and the producer of Bridesmaids…let’s call him the Francois Truffaut of movies with awkward lead characters and uncomfortable bathroom scenes that make a basquillion dollars.</p>
<p>Here’s what Judd said in an interview just last year:</p>
<p>“In every situation I walk into, I feel like the weirdo. The awkward guy…I feel that way on the set of my own movies. I never feel like I own the moment, even when I’m everyone’s boss.”</p>
<p>Every time you struggle, and you think you should be skating along, you think you should be smooth, and unflappable and full of nothing but self-assurance, remember this: if you’re not afraid, you’re not doing anything interesting. And b: Everyone is afraid.</p>
<p>And remembering that part is a good thing – it’ll help give you empathy when you run into people in your first job out of college who try to make you feel small – that’s just fear telling them that making you tiny somehow embiggens them. I may have just made that word up. But it doesn’t. Embiggen them.</p>
<p>In fact, here’s a secret for when that person is eventually fired and you get their job. It’s yet another piece of advice that’s going feel scary: always surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. Hire them. Befriend them. In college, ask them to work on projects with you.</p>
<p>It will be uncomfortable. It will make you feel not-so-smart. Fight that feeling, because in fact, hiring people who are smarter than you proves that, at least when it comes to hiring people, you are smarter than them.</p>
<p>When we first started <a href="http://www.livewireradio.org/">Live Wire</a>, I asked my friend Stacy Bolt, who I knew was a better writer than me at the time, to be on the show. And there was a hesitation, of course, because we have this strange, uniquely human fear that if someone around us looks good, that automatically makes us look bad. But it’s really just the opposite. Stacy became a huge fan favorite, and just sharing the stage with her made me, and the show, look smarter and funnier (and because she has an incredibly impressive shoe collection, almost 37% more stylish!).</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just her presence that made all that happen, it was the fact that creativity is a lot like sports—our game rises to match the game of those around us. Sometimes, if we work hard enough, we can even surpass them. So if you keep surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you, eventually, you’ll be the smartest one in the room. But don’t get comfortable in there. As the saying goes, if you’re always the smartest person in the room, you need to find a better room. Preferably one with a comfy couch and a 100% employer-matched 401k.</p>
<p>And another thing – while it’s important to be aware of where you stand educationally and professionally, don’t spend a lot of time on those comparisons. Comparing your life to other people’s lives is the most immediate path to unhappiness you can take. The only life you should ever use as a comparison is your own ideal life. The question isn’t, “Am I as happy as she is?,” it’s simply, “Am I happy?”</p>
<p>Because you will never truly know how happy anyone is. Life is like Facebook – we all project an image of our best selves and leave out the parts where we feel awkward, or lonely, or wonder if we’ve chosen the right college, or life partner, or toilet paper. Are you happy with it, regardless of how it looks in comparison to your friend’s thicker, more luxurious toilet paper? Then yes. You made the right choice. (Although I hope it’s recycled, because this is Portland and if it’s not, the police may show up at your house.)</p>
<p>It’s just about time for you to get your diplomas and start partying like the rock stars that you are, but just a few more things before I go:</p>
<p>Be kind whenever possible, because you will always remember, and always regret the times when you were not.</p>
<p>Think of your life as a story, and ask yourself, “Is this a story I’d like to read? Do I like the protagonist? And which parts do I want to edit out?”</p>
<p>When you fall in love, be the one who loves more at least once. It will feel like a position of weakness, but it is not. You’re the brave one.</p>
<p>After college, you are going to go through a period in life where you wonder what the point of it all is, and whether or not you’ve made a huge mistake. That period is known as “adulthood.” Embrace it.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s all been done before. It just hasn’t been done by you, and that will make all the difference.</p>
<p>And this might be the most important thing I say tonight, so please remember it: don’t get a duvet cover for your bed. The only time the corners of the duvet and the corners of the comforter will ever line up is the very first time you put the comforter in, and after that you’ll be constantly fighting to keep the comforter from bunching up into one side of the duvet and you can get those metal clips that supposedly keep it in place, but inevitably those will annoy you too, so…y’know, just get a bedspread and be done with it.</p>
<p>In closing, I wish you luck, I wish you patience and happiness, and the bravery to ask the world for what you want from it and give it what it needs at every turn. And I’ll end with words from someone far more eloquent than myself, e.e. cummings:</p>
<p>“To be nobody but yourself in a world that’s doing its best to make you somebody else, is to fight the hardest battle you are ever going to fight. Never stop fighting.”</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
